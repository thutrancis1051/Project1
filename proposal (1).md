# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
“Guess The Song - How Wide is your Music Taste?”


TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Utilizing Python and TunePad, I will program the chords of variety of songs. The user will have the chance to play the game and guess the song.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I will execute my project my using IDLE as well as Tunepad, an online platform for creating music with Python. First, I will have to choose several songs to include in the game. I am thinking that I could either do different songs from different decades, or I could due exclusively Taylor Swift songs. By using Tunepad, I will try to make the program play certain songs with just the chords and melody. Additionally, I have to find a way to transfer the songs into a different medium to create a the guessing game. It will have to consist of if statements and booleans to see if the user input’s the right guess of the song. Then at the end, there can be a message about the player’s music taste. 


TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None, TA is Chong Li

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome means being able to program at least one song onto Tunepad and that song have some resemblance to sounding like the actual song.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome means being able to program at least a few songs on to Tunepad and being able to make the guessing game. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my project is that I am able to create a functioning game that plays songs I programmed through Tunepad and are audibly similar to the songs I chose. The program will print a few multiple choice options for the song and the player can pick A,B, or C. A player that guessed several songs can will be given the message along the lines of applauding their music knowledge and good ear where a player that does not guess any songs is given a different message.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
First, I have to pick several songs. Then, I need to watch tutorials on how to navigate Tunepad and learn how to program the songs. Afterwards, I need to figure out how to convert that into a game and create a points system in IDLE (maybe?). There will also be true or false statements if the player guesses correct or not .
